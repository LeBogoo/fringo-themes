# Fringo Themes

A repository of custom Fringo themes.

## Contributing

If you're using the GitHub website, you can just upload your theme file to the `themes` directory and create a pull request from there.

The file name should:

- be the lowercase name of your theme and the first part of the theme id.
- have a `.json` extension.

Example: "Fringo Blue" with the id "**d54b1d9c**-...." should be named `fringo-blue-d54b1d9c.json`.

Otherwise:

1. Fork and Clone the repository
2. Add your theme (with a file name like described above) to the `themes` directory
3. Commit your changes with a meaningful message and push to your fork
4. Create a pull request to the original repository

After your pull request is merged, your theme will be available in the theme browser in Fringo.
